# Codoxide.Outcome.Extensions.ThenTry

This library exists purely for backward compatibility with code that uses the `ThenTry` extension methods of `Outcome` library. Beyond that, use of `ThenTry` is no longer necessary as `Then` (from `Codoxide.Extensions.Then` now implements the same functionality by default).
